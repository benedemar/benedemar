I'm Benedetta, a passionate **Junior Full-Stack Developer** who loves exploring new technologies and building impactful web applications. 🔭

Currently, I'm focused on growing as a developer and taking on new projects that challenge me and help me learn. I’m always looking for ways to build scalable and efficient software! 💻

My ultimate goal is to provide **useful and well-structured** applications that can help a wide range of people in their day-to-day lives. 🌱

😄 **Some facts about me:**  
- 🍕 I'm from Italy and 23 years old.  
- 🎓 I just graduated with a **Bachelor’s Degree in Social Innovation, Communication, and New Technologies.**  
- 📔 Outside of coding, I love reading, music, and scrapbooking! My love for nature and animals runs deep, and I'm also passionate about self-improvement and mental health (I'm currently working on a project related to it!).  

If you want to connect, don't hesitate! I would love to create an inclusive network where we can support each other. 🥰
